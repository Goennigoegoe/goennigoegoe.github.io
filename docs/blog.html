      <p>I've added an about me to the website so that you have some info on me, although not that much.
      Obviously I'm not gonna put that much info about me on my website.<br>
      I've changed the font so that the website looks a bit cooler and also changed the font size for the blog and the title of the blog so that it looks nicer.<br>
      I've also changed the size of the devlog title font because I personally like the smaller devlog title size.<br><br>
      In my opinion web development like making a simple blog website with html and css is very easy and you don't need to use any website builder<br>
      like wordpress or wix to make a simple blog site.<br>
      I think that maybe making a new html file for every devlog will be nicer to read but the code might be hell to find and edit.<br><br>
      Right now I'm using Windows 10 but I'm thinking of switching to Arch linux instead of Windows 11 because I like arch linux more than Windows 11.<br>
      I think on Arch I will use GTK with Dracula theme so that it looks very nice. <br><br>
      
      I've added the projects and friend projects page and I will be adding projects soon. </p>
